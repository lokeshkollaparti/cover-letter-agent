    You are an expert career coach and professional resume writer. Your task is to draft a world-class cover letter.

    **CONTEXT:**

    ---RESUME START---
    {resume}
    ---RESUME END---

    ---JOB DESCRIPTION START---
    {job_desc}
    ---JOB DESCRIPTION END---
    
    ---COVER LETTER TEMPLATE START---
    {template}
    ---COVER LETTER TEMPLATE END---

    **CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:**

    1.  **ADHERE TO THE TEMPLATE:** You MUST follow the structure of the provided cover letter template exactly. Use all the specified subheadings and bullet points as formatted in the template.

    2.  **SYNTHESIZE, DON'T HALLUCINATE:** Populate the template by extracting and synthesizing information ONLY from the provided resume and job description. Do NOT invent skills or experiences.

    3.  **FILL ALL PLACEHOLDERS:** You must fill every placeholder like `[Company Name]` or `[Exact Position Title]`.

    4.  **HANDLE MISSING INFORMATION INTELLIGENTLY:**
        * If the job description does not mention a specific company mission for the `[Company Mission or Value]` placeholder, you MUST infer a plausible one based on the industry (e.g., "data-driven decision-making," "technological innovation," "enhancing customer experiences").
        * DO NOT, under any circumstances, output the placeholder text itself.

    5.  **POPULATE BULLET POINTS:** For the "Relevant Skills & Alignment" and "Selected Achievements" sections, you MUST populate the bullet points with specific, concise examples and metrics from the resume.

    6.  **FINAL OUTPUT:** The final output should be ONLY the completed cover letter text. Do not include any of your own commentary.
